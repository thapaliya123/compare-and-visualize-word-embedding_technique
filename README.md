# Compare and Visualize Word Embedding Techniques  
- It contains python script that trains and visualize popular word embedding techniques such as:
    - CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer
    - Word2Vec, FastText, Glove
    - BERT embeddings
- It uses following python packages:
    - `numpy`: for array processing, and matrix-vector operations
    -  `matplotlib`: for visualization (word embedding in our case)
    - `gensim`: for loading pretrained Word2Vec
    - `sickit-learn`: for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
    - `transformers`: for loading state-of-the-art models for natural language processing, including BERT and other contextualized word embedding models.
- We will compare the embeddings by selecting a set of words and retrieving their embeddings using each techniques mentioned above.
- Finally, we will visualize embeddings generated for each word using Matplotlib.
