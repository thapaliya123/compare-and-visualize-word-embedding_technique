# Compare and Visualize Word Embedding Techniques  
- It contains python script that trains and visualize popular word embedding techniques such as:
    - CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer
    - Word2Vec, FastText, Glove
    - BERT embeddings
- It uses following python packages:
    - `numpy`: for array processing, and matrix-vector operations
    -  `matplotlib`: for visualization (word embedding in our case)
    - `gensim`
    - `sickit-learn`
    - `transformers`
